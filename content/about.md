### Cyrus

I am an OBGYN doctor.

My ultimate goal is to realize the concept of "Digital Nature" within the field of medicine.

> Digital Nature, which is the natural environment of the post-ubiquitous computing era, consists of a seamless combination of computational resources and non-computational resources. - University of Tsukuba, Digital Nature Group

Born in 1996, the first computer OS I played was Windows Millennium Edition (Me). Since childhood, my "playground" has been the Internet. As a millennial and a digital native, I am moving toward my goal by integrating both my medical and non-medical careers.
